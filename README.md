### C++ templates

## Exercise 00:
###  Start with a few functions
Implement the following function templates:
• swap: Swaps the values of two given arguments. Does not return anything.
• min: Compares the two values passed in its arguments and returns the smallest one. 
• max: Compares the two values passed in its arguments and returns the greatest one.

## Exercise 01:
### Iter
Implement a function template iter that takes 3 parameters and returns nothing.
• The first parameter is the address of an array.
• The second one is the length of the array.
• The third one is a function that will be call on every element of the array.

## Exercise 02:
### Array
Develop a class template Array that contains elements of type T and that implements
the a few behaviors and functions
